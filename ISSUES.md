- Loading indicator.
- When add a new color the color wrap scrolls.
- Support for HSL and RGB.
- Add the percentages on the HSL values.
- Check: Chrome scrollbar apparently not displaying. (Nothing happened)
- Markup: change `<code>` to `<kbd>`.
- Scroll position wasn't being recorded.
- Enhace usability by providing current format and output indicators on the bottom.
